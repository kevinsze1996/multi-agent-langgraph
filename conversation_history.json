Matplotlib is a general-purpose plotting library, Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and provides additional visualization tools, Plotly is an interactive visualization library, and Pandas is used for data manipulation in the last example.",

Since there's another file named `main.py` in `.venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/dotenv/`, which seems to be a package-level implementation, I'll focus on reading and summarizing `main.py` from the `src` directory.\n\nTo achieve this, we can use Python's built-in `open()` function to read the file contents and then parse the code using a library like `ast` (Abstract Syntax Trees) or `sympy`.\n\nHere's an example of how you could write a simple script to read and summarize the `main.py` file from the `src` directory:\n\n```markdown\n# Read main.py in src folder and summarize it\n\nimport os\nimport ast\n\ndef summarize_main_py(src_dir):\n    # Construct the full path to main.py in the src directory\n    main_py_path = os.path.join(src_dir, 'main.py')\n\n    try:\n        with open(main_py_path, 'r') as file:\n            # Read the contents of main.py\n            code = file.read()\n\n            # Parse the code using ast\n            tree = ast.parse(code)\n\n            # Initialize a summary string\n            summary = \"Code summary:\\n\"\n\n            # Iterate over the top-level nodes in the AST\n            for node in tree.body:\n                if isinstance(node, ast.FunctionDef):  # Check if it's a function definition\n                    func_name = node.name\n                    num_params = len(node.args.args)\n                    return_type = node.args Defaults.__class__.__name__ or 'None'\n                    summary += f\"- Function {func_name} with {num_params} parameters and return type {return_type}\\n\"\n\n                elif isinstance(node, ast.ClassDef):  # Check if it's a class definition\n                    class_name = node.name\n                    num_bases = len(node.bases)\n                    summary += f\"- Class {class_name} with {num_bases} bases\\n\"\n\n            print(summary)\n\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(f\"main.py not found in '{src_dir}'\")\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    summarize_main_py('/path/to/your/project/src')\n```\n\nReplace `'/path/to/your/project/src'` with the actual path to your project's source directory.\n\nPlease note that this script provides a basic summary of the top-level nodes in the code, including function definitions and class definitions.

Here's a summary of its contents:\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe `main.py` file appears to be a Python script that interacts with the LLaMA chat model using the LangChain library. It sets up an agent and model configuration, defines a Pydantic model for structured output, and creates a graph state definition.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* The script imports various libraries and modules from LangChain and other dependencies.\n* It defines a set of agent personas (e.g., \"therapist\", \"logical\", \"planner\", etc.) with their respective system prompts.\n* The `AGENT_CONFIG` dictionary stores these agent configurations, which will be used to interact with the LLaMA model.\n* A Pydantic model (`MessageClassifier`) is defined to structure the output from the LLaMA model. This model has a single field `message_type`, which is annotated as a literal string value.\n* The script defines a graph state definition (`State`) that includes various fields, such as `messages`, `next_agent`, and `tool_results`. These fields will be used to track the conversation flow.\n* A function `classify_message` is defined, which uses the LLaMA chat model to classify the user's message into one of the agent personas. This function is likely intended to be used in a larger conversational AI system.\n\n**Code Snippets:**\n\nHere are some relevant code snippets from the `main.py` file:\n```python\nimport json\nfrom langchain_ollama.chat_models import ChatOllama\n\n# Define the LLaMA model and agent configurations\nLOCAL_MODEL_NAME = \"llama3.2\"\nAGENT_CONFIG = {\n    # ... (agent personas and prompts)\n}\n\n# Define the Pydantic model for structured output\nclass MessageClassifier(BaseModel):\n    message_type: Literal[\n        \"therapist\", \"logical\", \"planner\", \"coder\", \"brainstormer\", \"debater\", \"teacher\"\n    ] = Field(\n        ...,  # (description and other fields)\n    )\n\n# Define the graph state definition\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]\n    next_agent: str | None\n    tool_results: dict | None\n    available_tools: list | None\n\n# Define a function to classify user messages\ndef classify_message(state: State):\n    # ...

Yes, I do know a thing or two about Sweden.\n\nLet me tell you a little story to help you understand this amazing country better. Imagine Sweden as a cozy cabin in the woods. On the surface, it might seem like just another quiet, rural destination. But scratch beneath that surface, and you'll find a vibrant culture, stunning natural beauty, and a thriving economy.\n\nSweden is known for its commitment to social welfare, equality, and environmental sustainability. The country has a strong focus on education, innovation, and design \u2013 which explains why Swedish brands like Spotify, Skype, and IKEA have become household names worldwide.\n\nOne fascinating aspect of Sweden is its concept of \"Lagom\" (pronounced lah-gohm). Lagom roughly translates to finding balance in life. It's about embracing moderation and simplicity, rather than overindulging or striving for the extreme. This philosophy has influenced Swedish design, architecture, and even their approach to food \u2013 think cozy cafes serving delicious, locally-sourced meals.\n\nAnother interesting aspect of Sweden is its unique cultural identity, which combines elements of Nordic traditions with a modern twist. For example, the Swedish concept of \"Fika\" (pronounced fee-kah) is all about taking breaks to enjoy good company, coffee, and baked goods. It's a way of life that encourages slowing down and appreciating the simple things.\n\nLastly, Sweden has made significant strides in embracing diversity and inclusivity. The country has been at the forefront of LGBTQ+ rights, refugee policies, and social justice initiatives \u2013 making it an attractive destination for people from all walks of life.\n\nSo, what would you like to know more about regarding Sweden? Its history, culture, economy, or something else?",

I'll provide a summary of the `main.py` file in the `src` folder.\n\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe `main.py` file appears to be a Python script that utilizes various libraries, including LangGraph, MCP Client, and Pydantic. Here's a high-level overview:\n\n1. **Importing Libraries**: The script imports necessary libraries, including `json`, `asyncio`, `typing`, and others.\n2. **MCP Configuration**: It sets up the MCP (Machine Learning Platform) configuration using the `mcp_manager` function from `mcp_client.config`. This configuration seems to be used for interacting with the MCP client.\n3. **Agent Configuration**: The script defines a dictionary (`AGENT_CONFIG`) that contains various agent personas, each with its own prompt and characteristics.\n4. **Message Classification**: The `classify_message` function is defined, which takes a `State` object as input. This function appears to use a Language Model (LLM) from the LangGraph library to classify the user's message into one of the predefined categories (e.g., \"therapist\", \"logical\", etc.). The classification result determines which agent persona should be used next.\n5. **Tool Execution**: The script uses the `determine_and_execute_tools_sync` function from `mcp_client.tools` to execute a set of tools based on the current agent and tool configuration.\n\n**Code Snippets**\n\nHere's a code snippet that summarizes the `classify_message` function:\n```python\ndef classify_message(state: State):\n    llm = ChatOllama(model=LOCAL_MODEL_NAME, format=\"json\")\n    classifier_llm = llm.with_structured_output(MessageClassifier)\n    last_message = state[\"messages\"][-1]\n    \n    # Pre-check for obvious file operations to bypass LLM classification issues\n    message_lower = last_message.content.lower()\n    file_indicators = [\n        # File extensions\n        '.py', '.md', '.txt', '.json', '.js', '.html', '.css', '.yaml', '.yml', '.xml', '.csv',\n        # File operations\n        'read file', 'open file', 'show file', 'display file',\n        'read the', 'open the', 'show the', 'display the',\n        'main.py', 'readme.md', 'config.json'\n    ]\n    \n    has_read_word = any(word in message_lower for word in ['read', 'open', 'show', 'display'])\n    has_file_indicator = any(indicator in message_lower for indicator in file_indicators)\n    \n    if has_read_word and has_file_indicator:\n        print(\"\ud83c\udfaf Pre-classification: Detected file operation, forcing 'coder' agent\")\n        agent_name = \"coder\"\n        available_tools = MCP_TOOLS_CONFIG.get(agent_name, [])\n        print(f\"\ud83d\udd0d Message classified as: '{agent_name}' agent\")\n        print(f\"\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f  Available tools: {available_tools}\")\n        return {\n            \"next_agent\": agent_name,\n            \"available_tools\": available_tools,\n            \"tool_results\": {},\n```\nThis function uses a Language Model to classify the user's message and determines which agent persona should be used next based on the classification result.",

The agent is designed to classify user input into various categories, such as \"therapist,\" \"logical,\" or \"coder.\" \n\n**Key Components**\n\n1.  **Agent Configuration**: The code defines an `AGENT_CONFIG` dictionary containing different agent personas with their respective prompts.\n2.  **Pydantic Model for Structured Output**: A custom Pydantic model `MessageClassifier` is created to classify user messages into one of the specified categories.\n3.  **Graph State Definition**: A `State` class is defined using a typed dictionary to store relevant information, including messages, next agent, tool results, and available tools.\n4.  **Graph Nodes**: The code defines a function `classify_message` that takes a `State` object as input and uses the LangGraph library's `ChatOllama` model with structured output to classify user messages.\n\n**Functionality**\n\n1.  When a user inputs a message, the agent attempts to classify it using the `classify_message` function.\n2.  If the message contains keywords like \"read\" or file indicators (e.g., `.py`, `.md`), the agent determines that it's a \"coder\" task and assigns it to this category.\n3.  The classified result is stored in the `State` object, including the next agent, available tools, and tool results.\n\n**Example Usage**\n\nTo use this code, you would need to create an instance of the `ChatOllama` model with the desired language model, then call the `classify_message` function with a user input message as an argument. The returned classified result can be used to determine the next action or provide a response.\n\n```python\n# Example usage:\nllm = ChatOllama(model=\"local_model_name\", format=\"json\")\nlast_message = {\"content\": \"read main.py in src\"}\nstate = classify_message(last_message)\nprint(state)  # Output: {'next_agent': 'coder', ...}\n```\n\n**Code Refactoring Suggestions**\n\n*   The `classify_message` function is quite long and performs multiple operations. Consider breaking it down into smaller functions for better readability and maintainability.\n*   The code assumes that the user input will always contain file indicators or keywords indicating a \"coder\" task. You may want to add additional checks or handling for other cases to improve robustness.\n*   The `AGENT_CONFIG` dictionary can be expanded to include more agent personas and their respective prompts, making the agent more versatile and useful.",
