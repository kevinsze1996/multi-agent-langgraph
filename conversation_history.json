Expect an average of 40-60 mm (1.6-2.4 in) of precipitation throughout the winter season.\n\nIt's essential to note that temperatures can fluctuate significantly within a day, and cold snaps are not uncommon during this time.",

Matplotlib is a general-purpose plotting library, Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and provides additional visualization tools, Plotly is an interactive visualization library, and Pandas is used for data manipulation in the last example.",
